The research organized states into four groups based on their payday lending laws: few safeguards, some safeguards, reformed, and restrictive. States with few safeguards have lending without meaningful protections to ensure affordable payments; APRs above 250%; and single-payment loans. Those states with some safeguards require lower-than-average prices and provide limited protections against high costs or borrowing repeatedly because payments are unaffordable. Reformed states have enacted comprehensive legislation, which lowers the cost of payday loans, requires that loans be repayable in affordable installments, and preserves consumersâ€™ access to credit.

The 18 states and Washington, D.C., that fall into the restrictive category have strong laws that prohibit payday loans or set low interest rate limits. Payday lenders do not operate in these jurisdictions. The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia. They and Washington, D.C., are omitted from this interactive table.
